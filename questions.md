## Questions
+ Managing mutable state/creating immutable objects
+ Duplication of testsâ€”does "no more of a test than sufficient to fail" mean not testing all squares or the other player?
+ Board.isFull() requires Row.isFull(). What happens if I need to change a different class to pass a test? Start by writing a new row test? (This is what I've been doing).
